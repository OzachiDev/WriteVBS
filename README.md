# WriteVBS
WriteVBS is the fastest way to write automatically things in Batch&VBS!

# How to use it?
You just have to include this function in your Batch code:
```bat
:WriteVBS :: by Ozachi
(echo set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject^(^"WScript.Shell^"^)&echo WshShell.SendKeys ^(^"%~1^"^)) > %temp%\write.vbs&%temp%\write.vbs
goto :eof
```
So you can call WriteVBS anytime:
```bat
call :WriteVBS "Text to write !~"
```
